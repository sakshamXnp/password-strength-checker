# 🔐 Password Strength Checker

**Password Strength Checker** is a Python-based security tool designed to analyze and evaluate the strength of user passwords using multiple criteria.  
It calculates entropy to measure randomness, estimates crack time based on brute-force attack speed, and checks for common weaknesses such as short length, lack of character diversity, predictable sequences, and repeated patterns.

The program provides real-time feedback with clear recommendations to help users create stronger and more secure passwords.  
This project combines **practical cybersecurity concepts** with **Python programming**, making it ideal for beginners learning about password security, entropy, and brute-force resistance.

It’s a simple yet educational tool that demonstrates how modern password evaluation works behind the scenes — perfect for students, ethical hackers, and anyone interested in **cybersecurity fundamentals**.
